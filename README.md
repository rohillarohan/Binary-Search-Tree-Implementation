# Binary-Search-Tree-Implementation
Implementing Binary Search Tree using Dynamic Memory Allocation

The Data Structure has been implemented in C using Dynamic memory allocation.
It has the following methods:
- insert_node(): It takes an integer value and inserts it in the BST according to its magnitude.
  delete_node(): This function deletes a node based on where it is situated and how many children it has. It can be a leaf node with no   children or a node with only one child or a node with two children.
  preorder(): This function traverses the whole tree based on the parent->left child->right child.
  inorder(): This function traverses the whole tree based on the left child->parent->right child. Also gives us an ascending order of the nodes.
  postorder(): This function traverses the whole tree based on the right child->parent->left child. Also gives us an descending order of the nodes.
